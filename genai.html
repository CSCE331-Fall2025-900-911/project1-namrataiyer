            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <div class="bio-placeholder">
                <p>I began learning Bharatanatyam at the age of 5 from Smt. Radhika Muralidharan, who gave me my early years of dance training and instilled in me a deep love for this art form. I have been a student of Smt. Vaishnavi Manoharan for the past 10 years and have been learning the breadth and nuances of dance.</p>
                <p>I recently completed my arangetram with Vaishnavi aunty on August 8th, 2025. This is a goal I have been working towards for a long time, and with even more effort since the beginning of sophomore year. I spent the entire summer in New Jersey, practicing dance in a gurukulam style where I stayed in my teacher’s house and spent most of my waking hours in practice.</p>
